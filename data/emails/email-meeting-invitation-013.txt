Subject: Daily Stand-Up Meeting Reminder
Dear Team,
I hope this email finds you well. This is a reminder that we will be having our daily stand-up meeting starting tomorrow, Monday, April 4th at 9:00 am, and continuing every weekday thereafter until further notice.
The purpose of the daily stand-up meeting is to ensure effective communication and collaboration among team members, to help us stay on track with our goals, and to identify and address any issues or obstacles that may be hindering our progress.
Please note that this meeting will be a short, 15-minute check-in session, in which each team member will be asked to share their progress, plans, and any blockers they are facing. The meeting will be led by our Scrum Master, John Smith, and it will take place in the conference room on the 2nd floor.
To ensure that we start on time and are able to cover everything we need to in the allotted time, please be prompt and prepared to share your updates.
Here is the agenda for the meeting:
Introductions and welcome (John Smith)
Progress report from each team member
Plans for the day
Identification and resolution of any blockers
Closing remarks (John Smith)
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or John Smith.
Thank you, and see you tomorrow.
Best regards,
Amy Chen
