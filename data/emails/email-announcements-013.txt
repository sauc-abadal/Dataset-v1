Subject: Company-wide Wellness Challenge
Dear team,
I am excited to announce a new initiative at Health Haven: a company-wide wellness challenge. This challenge is designed to help our employees improve their physical, mental, and emotional health, and to promote a culture of wellness and self-care.
The challenge will run for four weeks, from Monday, April 19th, to Sunday, May 16th, and will include various activities and goals, such as:
Tracking daily steps and exercise minutes
Trying new healthy recipes and foods
Practicing mindfulness and meditation
Participating in virtual fitness classes
Connecting with a wellness buddy for support and accountability
We believe that this challenge will not only benefit our individual employees, but also improve our productivity, creativity, and engagement as a company.
Please refer to the attached document for more details and instructions on how to participate. We encourage everyone to join and to have fun while taking care of themselves.
Thank you for your commitment to your health and well-being, and we look forward to a successful wellness challenge at Health Haven.
Best regards,
Amy Chen
Wellness Coordinator
