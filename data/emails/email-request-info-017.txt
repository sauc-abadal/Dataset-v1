Subject: Request for Inventory Information
Dear Emily,
I hope this email finds you well. As we continue to optimize our inventory management, I would like to request some information regarding our inventory levels. Could you please provide me with a summary of our current inventory levels, including the stock of each product and its location? Additionally, I require the average time it takes to restock items and any inventory management tools we can use to improve our processes.
Your assistance in this matter is much appreciated, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards,
Mike Park
