Subject: Request for Sales Data
Dear Sales Team,
I am writing to request your assistance in compiling and analyzing the sales data for our Q1 performance report. As you know, this report is a critical document that informs our stakeholders, shareholders, and executives about our revenue, market share, and growth prospects, and helps us make informed decisions about our strategies and investments.
To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the report, we need your help in providing us with the following information:
Total sales revenue by product line and region
Average unit price and volume sold by product line and region
Top 5 customers by revenue and product line
Sales trends and forecasts for the rest of the year
Please send us the requested data in the attached spreadsheet template, and label the data with clear and consistent names and units. Please also ensure that the data is up-to-date and reflects any changes or updates since the last report.
We appreciate your collaboration and timely response, and we look forward to a successful Q1 report. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me or the reporting team.
Best regards,
John Lee
Business Intelligence Manager
Xenia Corporation
