Subject: Request for Supplier Information
Dear Michael,
I hope this email finds you well. As we continue to optimize our supply chain, I would like to request some information regarding our suppliers. Could you please provide me with a list of our current suppliers, their product lines, and the average lead time for delivery? Additionally, I would like to know about any current or potential supply chain disruptions and how we can mitigate their impact.
Your assistance in this matter is much appreciated, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards,
Samantha Chen
