Subject: Request for HR Policies and Procedures
Dear HR Team,
I am writing to request your assistance in providing me with the latest versions of our HR policies and procedures manual. As a new employee at Innovate Solutions, I want to ensure that I am familiar with our company's standards, guidelines, and expectations regarding employee performance, conduct, benefits, and development.
I would appreciate it if you could send me the following documents in electronic format:
Employee handbook
Code of conduct
Performance management policy
Compensation and benefits policy
Training and development policy
Please also let me know if there are any other relevant documents or resources that you recommend for me to review, and if there are any specific procedures or deadlines that I need to follow as part of my onboarding process.
Thank you for your assistance and support, and I look forward to working with you at Innovate Solutions.
Best regards,
Michelle Wong
Software Engineer
Innovate Solutions
