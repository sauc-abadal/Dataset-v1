Subject: Request for Financial Data
Hi Rachel,
I hope this email finds you well. As part of our year-end financial review, I need some data from the accounting department. Could you please provide me with the latest balance sheet and income statement? In addition, I also require a breakdown of our expenses by department for the past quarter. Your prompt response is appreciated.
Best regards,
David Lee
