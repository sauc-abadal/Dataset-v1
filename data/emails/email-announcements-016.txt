Subject: Launch of New Employee Wellness Program
Dear all,
I am pleased to announce that we are launching a new employee wellness program at Bright Health, called "Healthy Habits, Happy Minds". The program aims to promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being among our employees, through a range of activities and resources.
Some of the program highlights include:
Weekly fitness classes, such as yoga, Pilates, and cardio
Mindfulness workshops, meditation sessions, and stress management tools
Nutrition counseling and healthy eating tips
Employee assistance program, providing confidential counseling and referrals
Incentives and rewards for participation and progress
We believe that investing in our employees' wellness is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do, as it can improve productivity, morale, and retention. We encourage everyone to take advantage of the program and make it a part of their daily routine.
Please refer to the attached document for more details on the program and how to enroll. The program officially starts on Monday, April 12th, but you can sign up now to get a head start.
Thank you for your attention, and we wish you a healthy and happy year ahead at Bright Health.
Best regards,
Carla Rodriguez
Director of Human Resources
Bright Health
