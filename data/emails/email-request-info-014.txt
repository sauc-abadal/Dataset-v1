Subject: Request for Financial Data
Dear Emily,
I hope this email finds you well. As part of our year-end financial review, I need some data from the accounting department. Could you please provide me with the latest balance sheet and income statement? In addition, I require a breakdown of our expenses by department for the past quarter and any updates on our cash flow projections.
Your assistance in this matter is much appreciated, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards,
David Kim
