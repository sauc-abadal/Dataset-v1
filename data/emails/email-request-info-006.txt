Hi Karen,
I hope this email finds you well. I am currently working on a cost optimization project and I need some supplier information to help me make informed decisions. Could you please provide me with a list of our current suppliers, their product lines, and the average lead time for delivery? Thank you for your cooperation.
Best regards,
Michael Scott
