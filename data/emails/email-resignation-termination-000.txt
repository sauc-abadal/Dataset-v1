Subject: Farewell from GlitterCorp
Dear All,
It is with a heavy heart that I am writing to inform you that I have decided to resign from my position as Senior Marketing Manager at GlitterCorp. My time at GlitterCorp has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my career, and I will cherish the memories and experiences that I gained while working with this incredible team.
I would like to thank my colleagues, my manager, and the leadership team at GlitterCorp for their unwavering support throughout my tenure here. I have learned so much from each and every one of you and I will forever be grateful for the opportunities and growth that I received while working here.
I am confident that GlitterCorp will continue to thrive and achieve great things, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
Thank you again for the wonderful experience, and I look forward to staying in touch with everyone.
Best regards,
Jenna Sparkle
