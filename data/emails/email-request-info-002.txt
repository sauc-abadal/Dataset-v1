Subject: Request for Budget Proposals
Dear Department Heads,
I am writing to request your department's budget proposal for the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1st. As you know, the budget proposal is a critical document that outlines your department's goals, priorities, and resource needs, and helps us allocate and prioritize our resources effectively.
To ensure that your proposal is aligned with the company's overall strategy and budget guidelines, please follow the attached template and instructions, and include the following information:
Overview of your department's mission, vision, and objectives
Key performance indicators and targets for the next year
Budget requirements for salaries, benefits, travel, training, equipment, and other expenses
Explanation of any changes or initiatives that require additional resources
Alignment with the company's values, priorities, and sustainability goals
Please submit your proposal by May 1st, and schedule a meeting with me or the finance team to discuss any questions or concerns you may have.
Thank you for your cooperation and collaboration, and we look forward to a successful budget planning process.
Best regards,
Mark Chen
Chief Financial Officer
InnoTech Group
